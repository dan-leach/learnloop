Current:
Check how edit works with new multistep form

To do
Preview certificate
Reuse images uploaded for a session on another slide - have a add a previously uploaded image button which launches gallery and adds the src to the uploader preview array
Indicate the default questions on feedback create
Static slide content overlapping ediges on mobile (see screenshot on AM teams convo)

Later:
Use sessionStorage to enforce submission limits - make sure there is a work around for preview mode
Add host view images to slide type help
Add imageCloud to slide type help
Image compression for large uploads
API for fetching images that checks valid session ID, then make img/ private
Have arrow keys control slide movements
Add auto-create feedback session for an interact session?
Add interaction related quotes

BEFORE BUILD:

1. Change path to images in EditQuestionForm.vue questionTypeInfo to relative
2. Update the path to the api in src/data/api.js to be relative not absolute
3. Re-enable sendMail for errors in api/index.php

ON BETA-END:

1. Remove from api/interact/routes [insertSession] beta-testers email check

3. On homepage move interact card back into same d-flex div as feedback card and remove beta-testing warning
4. Remove betaTester.php import in api/index.php and remove betaTester.php file
5. Update config repo URL
6. Reset logo src to @/assets/logo.png

ON DEPLOY:

1.  Add this htaccess to enable navigation directly to specified views (rather than only once the root has been loaded):
    <IfModule mod_negotiation.c>
    Options -MultiViews
    </IfModule>

        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
        </IfModule>

2.  Remove the allow CORS from the htaccess in dev.learnloop.co.uk
3.  Check directory privacy attached to api/private/ and api/shared/
4.  Remove dev per readme
