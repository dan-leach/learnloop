Current:

Later:
check how old feedback sessions function on the new frontend and api
Privacy policy
check group transition applied everywhere
Add spinners to buttons awaiting API response - is this finished? - check it matches the styling in create interact session btn
Check buttons same style everywhere
Check cookies work as expected

Improvements:
Preview of feedback form, question, interaction
Prevent subsession update email when that subsession hasn't changed
Convert downloads to modal pop ups to make different options (like downloading just subsession feedback) clearer
Create readme and changelog
Update api to use modern js fetch
Add close interaction option (to lock out further responses e.g. after revealing answer)
Add auto-create feedback session for an interact session?

BEFORE BUILD:

1. Remove form actions 'https://dev.learnloop.co.uk/api' change to 'api/'
2. Change path to images in EditQuestionForm.vue questionTypeInfo to relative
3. Check if any feedback sessions exist in live database with id starting with 'i' and do retroactive fix to change to 'f' and email facilitator

ON DEPLOY:

1.  Add this htaccess to enable navigation directly to specified views (rather than only once the root has been loaded):
    <IfModule mod_negotiation.c>
    Options -MultiViews
    </IfModule>

        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
        </IfModule>

2.  Remove the allow CORS from the htaccess in dev.learnloop.co.uk
3.  Update the path to the api in src/data/api.js to be relative not absolute
4.  Check directory privacy attached to api/private/ and api/shared/
5.  re-enable sendMail for errors in api/index.php
