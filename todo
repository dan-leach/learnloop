ON DEPLOY:

1. Add this htaccess to enable navigation directly to specified views (rather than only once the root has been loaded):
        <IfModule mod_negotiation.c>
        Options -MultiViews
        </IfModule>

        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
        </IfModule>

2. Remove the allow CORS from the htaccess in dev.learnloop.co.uk
3. Update the path to the api in src/data/api.js to be relative not absolute
4. Check directory privacy attached to api/private/ and api/shared/ 
5. re-enable sendMail for errors in api/index.php
