Current:

Later:
check how old feedback sessions function on the new frontend and api
Check cookies work as expected

Improvements:
Preview of feedback form, question, interaction
Prevent subsession update email when that subsession hasn't changed
Convert downloads to modal pop ups to make different options (like downloading just subsession feedback) clearer
Create readme and changelog
Update api to use modern js fetch
Add close interaction option (to lock out further responses e.g. after revealing answer)
Add auto-create feedback session for an interact session?
Add interaction related quotes
Add mailto links to privacy policy

BEFORE BUILD:

1. Remove form actions 'https://dev.learnloop.co.uk/api' change to 'api/'
2. Change path to images in EditQuestionForm.vue questionTypeInfo to relative
3. Check if any feedback sessions exist in live database with id starting with 'i' and do retroactive fix to change to 'f' and email facilitator
4. Update the path to the api in src/data/api.js to be relative not absolute
5. Re-enable sendMail for errors in api/index.php

ON BETA-END:

1. Remove from api/interact/routes [insertSession] beta-testers email check
2. Remove from interact/create beta-testers Swal fire and it's else block
3. On homepage move interact card back into same d-flex div as feedback card and remove beta-testing warning
4. Remove betaTester.php import in api/index.php and remove betaTester.php file

ON DEPLOY:

1.  Add this htaccess to enable navigation directly to specified views (rather than only once the root has been loaded):
    <IfModule mod_negotiation.c>
    Options -MultiViews
    </IfModule>

        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
        </IfModule>

2.  Remove the allow CORS from the htaccess in dev.learnloop.co.uk
3.  Check directory privacy attached to api/private/ and api/shared/
