Compare with old PHP files to check for missed features/protections

Andy Mullet:
Presenter to be able to view next slide - open new tab synced to facilitatorIndex+1 and with usual host screen controls removed
People tried to separate word cloud words using return key, but came out as one long word - perhaps disable return key, or format on submit?
Other times people have tried to submit separate words which belong together. Which option is best?
Change single choice to true/false, multiple choice to default max options 1
Auto save during session creation - done
Preview can be joined by mobile device - clear submissions on exiting preview
Reuse images uploaded for a session on another slide - have a add a previously uploaded image button which launches gallery and adds the src to the uploader preview array
Show options (but not responses) on content view
Toggle content/responses to have response counter
Make lock slide instant on join page load
Correct answer option for true/false and multiple choice
Allow editing multiple choice answers on create
Indicate the default questions on feedback create
Reuse of presentation - create from template
Static slide content overlapping ediges on mobile (see screenshot on AM teams convo)

Add host view images to slide type help
Add imageCloud to slide type help
Add appVersion field to session entries in database
Image compression for large uploads
API for fetching images that checks valid session ID, then make img/ private
Have arrow keys control slide movements
Add auto-create feedback session for an interact session?
Add interaction related quotes

BEFORE BUILD:

1. Change path to images in EditQuestionForm.vue questionTypeInfo to relative
2. Update the path to the api in src/data/api.js to be relative not absolute
3. Re-enable sendMail for errors in api/index.php

ON BETA-END:

1. Remove from api/interact/routes [insertSession] beta-testers email check
2. Remove from interact/create beta-testers Swal fire and it's else block
3. On homepage move interact card back into same d-flex div as feedback card and remove beta-testing warning
4. Remove betaTester.php import in api/index.php and remove betaTester.php file
5. Update config repo URL
6. Reset logo src to @/assets/logo.png

ON DEPLOY:

1.  Add this htaccess to enable navigation directly to specified views (rather than only once the root has been loaded):
    <IfModule mod_negotiation.c>
    Options -MultiViews
    </IfModule>

        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
        </IfModule>

2.  Remove the allow CORS from the htaccess in dev.learnloop.co.uk
3.  Check directory privacy attached to api/private/ and api/shared/
4.  Remove dev per readme
