                <h2>LearnLoop Privacy Policy.</h2>
                <br>
                This policy explains about the use of cookies, and how your data is handled by LearnLoop. You must not use this website if you do not agree to this policy.
                <br><br><br>
                <h4>Give feedback</h4>
                <br>
                When you provide feedback using LearnLoop the data you enter (positive comments, constructive comments, overall score and (if defined by the facilitator) custom questions, and in the case of a session series the same data (except custom questions) for each subsession) are submitted to a server located within the United Kingdom. The transmission of your data is protected using SSL encryption, and is stored in an access controlled database, but cannot be guarranteed to be completely secure. This data will be stored for up to 5 years from the point of submission after which time it will be deleted. The feedback can be seen by the session organiser. In the case of a session series the organiser can see the overall feedback and the feedback for each subsession. The subsession facilitators can only see the feedback for their own session.
                <br><br>
                Neither the facilitator, nor LearnLoop, can identify you during the feedback submission process. The feedback database does not log your IP address or other identifying features about your device. However, bear in mind that comments you make might allow you to be identified.
                <br><br>
                If you want your data to be removed from the database please email <mark><a href="mailto:mail@learnloop.co.uk">mail@learnloop.co.uk</a></mark> with the details of your feedback. As your feedback is not directly attributable to you, you will need to provide details regarding the feedback text to allow the entry to be identified and removed.
                <br><br>
                If you leave a feedback form before submitting it, or if you use the 'Save Progress' button, LearnLoop will attempt to store the data you have entered as a cookie on your device for the next 24 hours. This allows you to return to the same form within the next 24 hours and pick up where you left off. This data could be seen by someone else if they return to the same form on LearnLoop within the following 24 hours using the same device, login and browser as you when you started completing the form. If you want to avoid this, simply remove any data you have entered before leaving the feedback form page.
                <br><br>
                After you have provided feedback you will have the opportunity to download a certificate, unless the facilitator had disabled this option. The details you enter (name and organisation) are recorded in an attendance register unless this option was disabled by the facilitator. Entries in the attendance register are not timestamped or linked to the feedback you provide to ensure this remains anonymous.
                <br><br>
                <h4>Request feedback</h4>
                <br>
                When you create a new session or session series using LearnLoop, the data you enter (session title, session date, facilitator name, facilitator email address, custom questions, and in the case of a session series: subsession titles, subsession facilitator names, subsession facilitator emails) are submitted to a server located within the United Kingdom. The transmission of your data is protected using SSL encryption, and is stored in an access controlled database, but cannot be guarranteed to be completely secure. This data will be stored for up to 5 years from the point of submission after which time it will be deleted. After the session is created an email will be sent to the facilitator email (and in the case of a session series, the subsession facilitator emails) confirming the session details, how to direct attendees to the feedback form, and how to view submitted feedback. You should only enter your own email address as the facilitator email address or (for example, in the case of the subsession facilitators) with the express permission of the facilitator if you are creating a session on their behalf.
                <br><br>
                Anyone who accesses the feedback form for your session (via the session ID, link or QR code) can view the session title, session date and facilitator name (and, in the case of a session series, the subsession titles and subsession faciltator names) but not the facilitator's (or subsession facilitators') email address.
                <br><br>
                If you want your data to be removed from the database please email <mark><a href="mailto:mail@learnlearn.co.uk">mail@learnloop.co.uk</a></mark> with the session ID and facilitator email.
                <br><br>
                Unless you disable email notifications at the time of creating the session you will receive an email each time an attendee submits feedback for your session (limited to a maximum of one email every 2 hours). You can disable further email notifications for a particular session using the link included in the email.
                <br><br>
                <h4>Other options</h4>
                <br>
                When you edit session details data is handled in the same fashion as for requesting feedback, please see above.
                <br><br>
                When you view feedback the data you enter (session ID and PIN) are submitted to a server located within the United Kingdom. The transmission of your data, and the response with the collected feedback data, is protected using SSL encryption but cannot be guarranteed to be completely secure.
                <br><br>
                When you view the attendance register the data you enter (session ID and PIN) are submitted to a server located within the United Kingdom. The transmission of your data, and the response with the collected attendance data, is protected using SSL encryption but cannot be guarranteed to be completely secure.
                <br><br>
                When you reset your PIN the data you enter (session ID and email) are submitted to a server located within the United Kingdom. The transmission of your data is protected using SSL encryption but cannot be guarranteed to be completely secure. You will receive an email with a new PIN for the session.
                <br><br>
                When you use the find my sessions option, the data you enter (email) are submitted a server located within the United Kingdom. The transmission of your data is protected using SSL encryption but cannot be guarranteed to be completely secure. You will receive an email with listing any sessions on you have created on LearnLoop which have not been deleted.
                <br><br>
                If you want all data relating to your sessions to be removed from the database please email <mark><a href="mailto:mail@learnloop.co.uk">mail@learnloop.co.uk</a></mark> with the session ID and facilitator email.
