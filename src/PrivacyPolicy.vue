            When you provide feedback using LearnLoop the data you enter
            (positive comments, constructive comments, overall score and (if
            defined by the facilitator) custom questions, and in the case of a
            session series the same data (except custom questions) for each
            subsession) are submitted to a server located within the United
            Kingdom. The transmission of your data is protected using SSL
            encryption, and is stored in an access controlled database, but
            cannot be guarranteed to be completely secure. This data will be
            stored for up to 5 years from the point of submission after which
            time it will be deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The feedback can be seen by the session organiser. In the case of a
            session series the organiser can see the overall feedback and the
            feedback for each subsession. The subsession facilitators can only
            see the feedback for their own session. Neither the facilitator, nor
            LearnLoop, can identify you during the feedback submission process.
            The feedback database does not log your IP address or other
            identifying features about your device. However, bear in mind that
            comments you make might allow you to be identified.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want your data to be removed from the database please email
            mail@learnloop.co.uk with the details of your feedback. As your
            feedback is not directly attributable to you, you will need to
            provide details regarding the feedback text to allow the entry to be
            identified and removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you leave a feedback form before submitting it, or if you use the
            'Save Progress' button, LearnLoop will attempt to store the data you
            have entered as a cookie on your device for the next 24 hours. This
            allows you to return to the same form within the next 24 hours and
            pick up where you left off. This data could be seen by someone else
            if they return to the same form on LearnLoop within the following 24
            hours using the same device, login and browser as you when you
            started completing the form. If you want to avoid this, simply
            remove any data you have entered before leaving the feedback form
            page.
          </p>
          <p>
            After you have provided feedback you will have the opportunity to
            download a certificate, unless the facilitator had disabled this
            option. The details you enter (name and organisation) are recorded
            in an attendance register unless this option was disabled by the
            facilitator. Entries in the attendance register are not timestamped
            or linked to the feedback you provide to ensure this remains
            anonymous.

            When you create a new session or session series using LearnLoop, the
            data you enter (session title, session date, facilitator name,
            facilitator email address, custom questions, and in the case of a
            session series: subsession titles, subsession facilitator names,
            subsession facilitator emails) are submitted to a server located
            within the United Kingdom. The transmission of your data is
            protected using SSL encryption, and is stored in an access
            controlled database, but cannot be guarranteed to be completely
            secure. This data will be stored for up to 5 years from the point of
            submission after which time it will be deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the session is created an email will be sent to the
            facilitator email (and in the case of a session series, the
            subsession facilitator emails) confirming the session details, how
            to direct attendees to the feedback form, and how to view submitted
            feedback. You should only enter your own email address as the
            facilitator email address or (for example, in the case of the
            subsession facilitators) with the express permission of the
            facilitator if you are creating a session on their behalf. Anyone
            who accesses the feedback form for your session (via the session ID,
            link or QR code) can view the session title, session date and
            facilitator name (and, in the case of a session series, the
            subsession titles and subsession faciltator names) but not the
            facilitator's (or subsession facilitators') email address.

            If you want your data to be removed from the database please email
            mail@learnloop.co.uk with the session ID and facilitator email.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless you disable email notifications at the time of creating the
            session you will receive an email each time an attendee submits
            feedback for your session (limited to a maximum of one email every 2
            hours). You can disable further email notifications for a particular
            session using the link included in the email.

            When you join an interact session using LearnLoop the data you enter

            located within the United Kingdom. The transmission of your data is

            Your responses can be seen by the session facilitator and in most
